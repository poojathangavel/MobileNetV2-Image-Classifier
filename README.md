This code classifies images using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. Here's what each part does:

1. **Import Libraries**:
    - TensorFlow and Keras for model loading and image processing.
    - NumPy for array manipulations.

2. **Load Pre-trained Model**:
    - Loads the MobileNetV2 model with weights pre-trained on ImageNet.

3. **Upload an Image**:
    - Uses Google Colab's upload utility to allow the user to upload an image file.

4. **Process the Uploaded Image**:
    - Loads and resizes the image to 224x224 pixels.
    - Converts the image to an array and preprocesses it to fit the model's input format.

5. **Make Predictions**:
    - Uses the model to predict the class of the image.

6. **Decode and Display Predictions**:
    - Decodes the prediction results into human-readable labels and displays the top 5 predictions with confidence scores.
